Negative properties test data set and documentation
It is organised in 3 sub-directories.
The first contains the four XML files and a word document outlining what each file is. This is the intended deliverable for testing and evaluation.
The second contains the source data used to generate the XML data in directory 1. It was produced by the first part of the program in directory 3 and is the complete reference for evaluating any work done with the XML data in directory 1.
The third directory contains the spreadsheet with all the design rules and evaluation counts for the files in the first directory and the R program used to generate them. Rerunning the program will produce a different data set, with different counts, as a random element is included in the data generation.
